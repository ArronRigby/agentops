## Highlights

Your coding agent can now recover its own context after compaction, monitor its own
health over time, and never break CI by adding a skill again. The crank engine — the
core execution loop — no longer bloats its own context window, fixing the biggest
performance bottleneck in long-running autonomous sessions.

## What's New

- **Context recovery skill** — `/recover` detects in-progress sessions after compaction and reloads everything needed to continue: pending tasks, recent work, knowledge artifacts
- **Vibe-check CLI** — `ao vibe-check` analyzes session health: stagnation, thrashing, drift, and regression detection with 60+ tests. Runs automatically at session end.
- **Crank context fix** — The autonomous execution engine no longer loads thousands of lines per wave. Worker results write to disk instead of flooding the orchestrator.
- **Skill count sync tool** — Adding a skill used to break CI because counts were hardcoded in 6 files. Now one script patches everything and CI catches drift automatically.

## All Changes

### Added

# v2.10.0

Four new skills, named council perspectives, and a full README rewrite.

## Highlights

- **`/brainstorm`** — Explore ideas before committing to a plan. Four-phase structured dialogue that captures goals, approaches, and design decisions.
- **`/heal-skill`** — Automated skill hygiene. Scans for missing frontmatter, dead references, name mismatches. `--fix` auto-repairs what it finds.
- **`/converter`** — Convert any AgentOps skill to Codex or Cursor format. Budget-fits Cursor .mdc files to 100KB, truncates Codex descriptions to 1024 chars.
- **Named perspectives for `/council`** — `--perspectives="security,perf,ux"` gives each judge a specific viewpoint. Or load from a YAML file with `--perspectives-file`. New `doc-review` preset included.

## What's New

### Skills (4 new, 42 total)

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/brainstorm` | Structured idea exploration before `/plan` |
| `/heal-skill` | Detect and fix skill hygiene issues |
| `/converter` | Convert skills to Codex/Cursor formats |
| `/readme` | README generation with council validation |

### Council Enhancements

- **Named perspectives** — Free-form (`--perspectives="a,b,c"`) or YAML-defined (`--perspectives-file=path`). Each judge adopts a specific viewpoint.
- **`doc-review` preset** — Four perspectives: clarity-editor, accuracy-verifier, completeness-auditor, audience-advocate.
- Perspectives override presets when both are specified. Judge count auto-escalates to match perspective count.

### README

Rewritten from scratch. Leads with the problem, adds a trust block near install, collapses depth into details blocks. Shows terminal transcripts instead of making claims.

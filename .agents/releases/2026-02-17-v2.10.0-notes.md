# v2.10.0

Four new skills, named council perspectives, a full README rewrite, and critical council stability fixes.

## Highlights

- **`/brainstorm`** — Explore ideas before committing to a plan. Four-phase structured dialogue that captures goals, approaches, and design decisions.
- **`/heal-skill`** — Automated skill hygiene. Scans for missing frontmatter, dead references, name mismatches. `--fix` auto-repairs what it finds.
- **`/converter`** — Convert any AgentOps skill to Codex or Cursor format. Budget-fits Cursor .mdc files to 100KB, truncates Codex descriptions to 1024 chars.
- **Named perspectives for `/council`** — `--perspectives="security,perf,ux"` gives each judge a specific viewpoint. Or load from a YAML file with `--perspectives-file`. New `doc-review` preset included.
- **Council context explosion fix** — Judges now write analysis to files and send a minimal 4-line completion signal. Prevents N judges from blowing up the lead's context window.
- **`Task(run_in_background=true)` banned for Claude agents** — Causes instability. All orchestration skills now use foreground `Task()` (parallel via multiple calls) or native teams as fallback.

## What's New

### Skills (4 new, 42 total)

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/brainstorm` | Structured idea exploration before `/plan` |
| `/heal-skill` | Detect and fix skill hygiene issues |
| `/converter` | Convert skills to Codex/Cursor formats |
| `/readme` | README generation with council validation |

### Council Enhancements

- **Named perspectives** — Free-form (`--perspectives="a,b,c"`) or YAML-defined (`--perspectives-file=path`). Each judge adopts a specific viewpoint.
- **`doc-review` preset** — Four perspectives: clarity-editor, accuracy-verifier, completeness-auditor, audience-advocate.
- Perspectives override presets when both are specified. Judge count auto-escalates to match perspective count.
- **Context budget rule** — Judges write full analysis to output files, send only `{verdict, confidence, file}` via message. Consolidation runs inline as the lead (no chairman agent). Debate R2 sends verdict summaries, not full JSON.
- **Background task ban** — `Task(run_in_background=true)` removed as fallback across council, swarm, research, and shared contracts. Foreground `Task()` calls (parallel via multiple calls in one message) replace it.

### README

Rewritten from scratch. Leads with the problem, adds a trust block near install, collapses depth into details blocks. Shows terminal transcripts instead of making claims.

### Reverse-Engineer RPI

- Increased 1:1 fidelity for CLI and artifact surface matching.

## All Changes

<summary>Full changelog</summary>

### Added

- `/brainstorm` skill — structured idea exploration (4 phases, output to `.agents/brainstorm/`)
- `/heal-skill` skill — automated hygiene checker with `--check` and `--fix` modes
- `/converter` skill — cross-platform converter (Codex, Cursor, test targets)
- `/readme` skill — README generation with council validation
- `/reverse-engineer-rpi` skill — feature inventory, code map, and spec generation
- Named council perspectives (`--perspectives`, `--perspectives-file`)
- `doc-review` council preset (4 documentation-focused judges)
- PRODUCT.md — product definition document

### Changed

- README rewritten — problem-first, trust block, details blocks
- Skill count 39 → 42 (32 user-facing, 10 internal), synchronized across 8 files
- Council SKILL.md consolidated to stay under 550-line limit
- Council judges send minimal completion signal (verdict + confidence + file path) instead of full analysis via SendMessage
- Council consolidation runs inline as team lead — no separate chairman agent
- Council debate R2 sends verdict summaries instead of full JSON verdicts
- `Task(run_in_background=true)` replaced with foreground `Task()` across council, swarm, research, shared, SKILL-TIERS, and validation-contract
- `reverse-engineer-rpi` increased 1:1 fidelity (CLI + artifact surface)

### Fixed

- Skill count validator excludes `.tmp` directories
- `brainstorm` trigger collision allowlisted
- `readme` skill added to SKILL-TIERS.md
- heal-skill example text no longer triggers false-positive dead-ref detection
- Council context explosion when spawning 7+ judges — messages flooded lead's context window

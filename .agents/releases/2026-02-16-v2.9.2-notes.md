## Highlights

**One command to set up any repo.** `ao init` replaces the scattered setup steps — it creates all directories, configures `.gitignore`, and optionally registers hooks. Run it once, you're done. Run it twice, nothing changes. Use `--stealth` to keep `.gitignore` clean.

**Automatic git protection.** Your `.agents/` directory now gets gitignored automatically on first session. If you accidentally stage agent artifacts, you'll get a warning before commit. No more secrets or session data leaking into git history.

**Security hardening across the hook system.** This release closes three vectors found during a full security audit: symlink-based file reads in the standards injector, command injection via crafted task metadata, and unverified hook sources during `--full` installation. All hooks now have tighter input validation.

## What's New

- **`ao init`** — Creates `.agents/` directories + `.gitignore` + optional hooks in one command. Supports `--stealth`, `--hooks`, `--dry-run`. 12 tests.
- **Auto-gitignore** — Session-start hook adds `.agents/` to `.gitignore` automatically. Dangerous-git-guard warns on staged `.agents/` files.
- **Symlink protection** — Standards injector rejects symlinked files to prevent arbitrary reads.
- **Hook source verification** — `ao hooks install --full` now requires a git-managed source directory.
- **Command injection fix** — Task validation gate blocks newlines and quotes in restricted commands.
- **Better release notes** — This release uses the new format. No more raw commit dumps on the GitHub Release page.

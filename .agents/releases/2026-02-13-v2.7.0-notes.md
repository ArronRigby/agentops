# AgentOps v2.7.0

The ao CLI gets a major upgrade: faster search, concurrent processing, and smarter defaults. Plus a README overhaul and alignment with the 4 pillars framework.

## Highlights

- **CASS is now the default search mode** — `ao search` uses maturity-weighted, session-aware search out of the box. Disable with `--cass=false` if you need plain keyword search.
- **Concurrent file processing** — Forge, search, and inject now process files in parallel via a generic worker pool, with progress indicators.
- **Inverted search index** — Fast keyword lookup without scanning every file. Rebuilt incrementally after each forge.
- **Expanded `ao doctor`** — 9 health checks covering CLI dependencies, hook coverage, knowledge freshness, search index, and flywheel health.

## What's New

- **ao CLI improvements** — 11-issue epic covering performance (worker pool, search index), UX (CASS default, progress indicators, pagination, dry-run flags), quality (unified table formatter, expanded doctor, unified status display), and cleanup (ratchet command grouping, OutOrStdout refactor, removed export_constraints stub).
- **README overhaul** — Dedicated ao CLI section, adoption path diagram, audience personas, competitive comparison table.
- **Deliberation consensus** — Repository aligned with 4 pillars framework, new mission statement, 42 fitness goals.
- **Council verdict schema v2** — Judges now emit structured FIX/WHY/REF fields per finding for actionable feedback.
- **`/evolve` runs forever** — No more 10-cycle cap. Loop runs until kill switch or 3 consecutive idle cycles.

## All Changes

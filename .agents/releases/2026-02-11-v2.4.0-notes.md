## Highlights

Skills now learn from your past work. Before spawning judges or decomposing plans,
`/plan`, `/pre-mortem`, and `/vibe` search the knowledge flywheel for prior learnings
relevant to your current task. The forge-extract loop is also wired into session
startup, so learnings accumulate automatically. This release also includes a hardening
sweep with schema validation, security fixes, and expanded test coverage.

## What's New

- **Skills search prior knowledge before acting** — `/plan`, `/pre-mortem`, and `/vibe` now query `ao search` for relevant learnings before council dispatch, so judges have historical context
- **Automatic knowledge extraction on session start** — `ao extract` runs at session startup to process pending learnings from previous sessions
- **Forge supports markdown files** — `ao forge markdown` can now mine `.md` files, not just `.jsonl` transcripts
- **Security hardening** — Command injection vulnerability in task-validation-gate replaced with allowlist-based execution

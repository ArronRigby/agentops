## Highlights

New users now see every skill from their first session. The onboarding walkthrough
and workflow reference have been updated to show all 26 user-facing skills with
natural language triggers. Install instructions now include the Homebrew tap so
`brew install agentops` works on the first try. Three release pipeline bugs fixed.

## What's New

- **Complete skill catalog in onboarding** — `/quickstart` and the auto-injected workflow reference now list all 26 skills, organized by phase (implement, validate, collaborate, explore, track, meta)
- **Install instructions that work on first try** — All `brew install` commands include the Homebrew tap prefix. No more "formula not found" for new users.
- **Release pipeline fixes** — GitHub Releases now show curated release notes instead of empty bodies

## All Changes

# v2.11.0

## Highlights

The `ao` binary now ships hooks embedded via Go `embed` — no more external hook file dependencies at runtime. This makes installation and distribution cleaner: one binary, everything included.

## What's New

- **Embedded hooks in ao binary** — Hooks are compiled into the binary using Go's `embed` package. Runtime no longer requires hook files on disk.
- **reverse-engineer-rpi improvements** — Comparison reports, binary mode self-test assertions, CLI surface spec with registry enrichment, and Go CLI `--help` capture.
- **8 new skills** — `pr-research`, `pr-plan`, `pr-implement`, `pr-validate`, `pr-prep`, `pr-retro`, `oss-docs`, and `openai-docs` for upstream contribution workflows and documentation.

## Fixes

- `ao pool auto-promote` defaults threshold corrected to 7 days
- `ao pool ingest` now moves processed files to `processed/`
- `ao doctor` search index path and remediation command fixed
- Broken links in oss-docs reference template fixed

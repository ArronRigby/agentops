## Highlights

Your agent can now improve itself in a loop. `/evolve` measures your repo against
fitness goals, picks the worst score, fixes it with a full research-plan-implement
cycle, then measures again — compounding knowledge with each pass. This release also
adds interactive product definition, test-driven development workflows, and hardened
hook error recovery.

## What's New

- **`/evolve` — autonomous improvement loop** — Define fitness goals in GOALS.yaml, run `/evolve`, and the system measures, fixes, and re-measures until everything passes or it hits the cycle cap. Each cycle feeds learnings into the next.
- **`/product` — interactive product definition** — Guided interview that generates a PRODUCT.md with mission, personas, and competitive landscape.
- **`/crank --test-first` — spec-first TDD** — Write specs and tests before implementation. Contracts, category validation, and blocked-recovery built in.
- **Hook error recovery** — All hook failures now include recovery suggestions and auto-handoff context instead of bare error messages.
- **Spec-completeness judge** — Council now validates that plans and specs are complete before implementation begins.

# v2.7.1

Patch release with quality improvements: simplified search, stronger crank guardrails, and expanded test coverage.

## Highlights

- **Crank now requires pre-mortem for 3+ issue epics** — After 7 consecutive epics showed positive ROI from pre-mortem validation, this is now enforced as a pre-flight check. Small epics (1-2 issues) are unaffected.
- **Search simplified** — Removed the inverted index search path. CASS is now opt-in (`--cass`) instead of the default, making `ao search` faster and simpler.

## What's New

### Changed

- Simplified `ao search` — removed index-based search, CASS now opt-in
- Updated README and PRODUCT.md with context orchestration framing
- Updated architecture docs — fixed broken links, clearer framing

### Fixed

- Crank pre-mortem gate — blocks cranking 3+ issue epics without pre-mortem evidence
- Added integration tests for `ao doctor`, `ao pool`, `ao search`, and `ao status`

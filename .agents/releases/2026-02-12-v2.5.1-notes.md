# AgentOps v2.5.1

Quality and coverage release — every skill now has behavioral tests, the Go CLI has significantly more test coverage, and large-repo workflows got deterministic context windowing.

## Highlights

- **Full behavioral test coverage** — All 34 skills now ship with validate.sh contracts (~280 automated checks). Previously only 8 skills had them.
- **Context windowing for large repos** — New shard-based tooling ensures `/rpi` can process any repo size within bounded context budgets.
- **Incident runbook** — First-party recovery procedures for consumers experiencing hook or skill issues.

## What's New

- 37 new Go CLI test functions boosting cmd/ao coverage from 25.1% to 30.5%
- 100 hook integration tests across all 12 hooks
- GOALS.yaml expanded from 17 to 20 fitness goals
- `--test-first` flag now passes through the full `/rpi` and `/evolve` lifecycle
- Evolve regression gate now re-checks all goals after each cycle (not just the target)
- 4 large skills extracted into progressive-disclosure references/

## Highlights

Three security vulnerabilities patched in hook scripts. The `/rpi` validation lifecycle
now retries automatically when validation fails instead of stopping — no manual
intervention needed. The five largest skills now load significantly faster by keeping
their entry points lean and loading reference docs only when needed.

## What's New

- **Self-healing validation** — Failed code reviews now retry automatically with failure context, instead of stopping and waiting for you
- **Faster skill loading** — Five core skills restructured to load reference content on demand instead of all at once
- **3 security fixes** — Command injection, regex injection, and JSON injection vulnerabilities patched in hook scripts
- **26 new integration tests** — Automated coverage for prompt nudging, push gating, and task validation hooks
- **Skill linting** — All 32 skills now declare metadata and are validated for structure, triggers, and dependencies

## All Changes

### Added

- Self-healing retry loop for the `/rpi` validation lifecycle
- Security and documentation sections for Go, Python, Rust, JSON, YAML language standards
- Tier metadata for all 32 skills with automated validation
- Council validation script (schema, presets, personas, output format)
- Skill linting across all skills (tier, triggers, tool declarations, dependencies)
- Reference file extraction for council, crank, implement, swarm, and vibe skills
- Documentation validation suite (link checking, skill count assertions, CLI reference generation)
- Project-wide INDEX, GLOSSARY, workflows guide, and CLI reference
- 26 hook integration tests (injection resistance, kill switches, allowlist enforcement)
- Monorepo-friendly quickstart detection

### Changed

- README rewritten with clearer install options and multi-agent compatibility FAQ
- Install script no longer fails when only one of several supported CLIs is present
- Vibe skill restructured for faster loading

### Fixed

- Regex injection in task validation hook (now literal matching)
- JSON injection in prompt nudge hook (now safe escaping)
- Team guard no longer blocks on dead tmux panes
- Skill counts corrected to 32 across all documentation
- Vibe default mode documented correctly as 3-judge deep mode
- 12 broken links and doc inaccuracies fixed across the project

### Removed

- Deprecated `/judge` skill (use `/council` instead)

## Highlights

Agent orchestration is now runtime-native across core skills. In Codex sessions, skills can use experimental sub-agents directly; in Claude sessions, they use native teams, with a safe fallback when richer APIs are unavailable. This removes backend-specific drift and keeps the same workflows usable across agents.

## What's New

- **Runtime-native orchestration contract** — Core orchestration skills now follow one backend selection order: Codex sub-agents, then Claude teams, then background-task fallback.
- **Codex sub-agent patterns documented** — Swarm and council references now include concrete spawn/wait/retry/cleanup flows for Codex sub-agents.
- **Docs aligned with actual behavior** — README, architecture, and reference docs now describe runtime-native execution instead of Claude-only team assumptions.
- **Validation tooling updated** — Skill validators were updated for the new runtime-agnostic model, and doc link checks remain green.

## All Changes

### Added

- Shared runtime-native backend selection contract for orchestration skills.
- Reference execution patterns for Codex sub-agent workflows in swarm and council docs.

### Changed

- Swarm, council, crank, and codex-team documentation to reflect runtime-universal backend selection.
- Council validator logic to validate generic judge counts instead of Claude-specific assumptions.
- Core documentation to describe runtime-native orchestration and coordination channels.
- Swarm validation script checks for backend selection and cleanup lifecycle docs.

### Fixed

- Release skill changelog link template so docs link validation passes.

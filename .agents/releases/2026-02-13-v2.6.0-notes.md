# AgentOps v2.6.0

**Skills guide alignment, micro-epic fast path, and headless Codex team-runner.**

## Highlights

- Every skill now follows the Anthropic official skills guide structure with examples and troubleshooting — better discoverability and self-service for new users.
- Small epics (3 or fewer issues) take a fast path through `/rpi`, skipping pre-mortem and swarm overhead.
- New headless team-runner for Codex agents with JSONL event streaming and structured output schemas.

## What's New

### Micro-Epic Fast Path
`/rpi` now detects small epics and routes them through a streamlined sequential path — no `/pre-mortem`, no `/swarm`. Reduces cycle time for quick fixes and small features.

### Anthropic Skills Guide Alignment
All 34 skills restructured with standardized YAML frontmatter, trigger documentation, and progressive disclosure. Each skill now includes usage examples and troubleshooting sections.

### Headless Codex Team-Runner
`lib/scripts/team-runner.sh` orchestrates parallel Codex agents from a JSON team spec, watching JSONL event streams for completion. New `team-spec.json` and `worker-output.json` schemas define the contract.

### Test-First Scaffolding
`/crank --test-first` gets spec-first TDD wave templates with RED gate enforcement — specs and tests written before implementation code.

## All Changes

### Added
- Micro-epic fast path for `/rpi` — skip pre-mortem + swarm for small epics

# v3 Roadmap: AgentOps

**Date:** 2026-02-15
**Status:** Draft
**Source:** v2.x trajectory analysis and retro learnings

## v2.x Arc Summary

The v2.x releases (v2.0.0–v2.8.0, 13 releases, 7 days, 27 epics) followed a natural maturity progression:

| Phase | Releases | Theme |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Build | v2.0–v2.2 | Skills, hooks, CLI infrastructure |
| Harden | v2.3–v2.4 | Testing, validation, multi-model council |
| Self-improve | v2.5–v2.6 | Evolve loop, knowledge flywheel, crank automation |
| Explain | v2.7 | Documentation, positioning, product definition |
| Constrain | v2.8 | Worktree isolation, context discipline, release gates |

**Key metrics:** Cycle time 45→15 min. Pre-mortem ROI positive 7+ consecutive epics. Zero data loss incidents.

## v3 Identity

v2 answered: "Can a coding agent get smarter every session?" → Yes.

v3 asks: "Can others adopt this, and can agents coordinate across boundaries?"

## Themes

### Theme 1: Adoption — Remove Barriers to First Use

**Rationale:** v2 is powerful but assumes familiarity with RPI, beads, knowledge flywheel. New users need guided onramps, not just `/quickstart`.

- Progressive onboarding (session 1 → session 5 → session 20 capability unlocks)
- Sensible defaults that work without configuration
- Clear "you are here" indicators at every stage
- Reduce skill count cognitive load (group by user journey, not by architecture)

### Theme 2: Ecosystem — Support Multiple Repositories and Teams

**Rationale:** AgentOps currently assumes single-repo operation. Real teams work across repositories with shared knowledge.

- Cross-repo knowledge sharing (learnings from repo A available in repo B)
- `target_repo` field in next-work harvesting (already planned: ag-3ksw)
- Federated knowledge pools with trust boundaries
- Team-level dashboards and progress tracking

### Theme 3: Federation — Agent-to-Agent Coordination

**Rationale:** v2 agents coordinate within a session (native teams, swarm). v3 agents should coordinate across sessions and across time.

- Persistent agent identity (beyond single session)
- Cross-session task handoff (not just context handoff)
- Agent reputation and capability ledger (started in Gas Town)
- Conflict resolution for concurrent modifications

### Theme 4: Observability — Make the System Legible

**Rationale:** L7 taught us context limits are architectural. We need to see what agents are doing without consuming their context.

- Stream-JSON progress output for `ao rpi phased` (already planned: ag-cjrd)
- Observable orchestration (already planned: ag-ae0v)
- Cost and token tracking per epic/cycle
- Regression detection in knowledge quality

### Theme 5: Hardening — Production-Grade Reliability

**Rationale:** v2.8 added constraints. v3 makes them enforceable at scale.

- Formal test contracts (spec-first TDD via `--test-first`)
- Release size enforcement (advisory → blocking)
- Knowledge staleness detection and pruning
- Automated regression testing for skill behavior changes

## Anti-Goals

- **No README rewrite** until v3 identity is clear (L3: rewrites signal unclear identity)
- **No new skill categories** — consolidate existing skills before expanding
- **No multi-language support** — stay focused on the coding agent use case
- **No hosted service** — AgentOps is a local-first tool

## Migration Path

v3.0.0 should be backward-compatible with v2.x:
- All existing skills continue to work
- GOALS.yaml format unchanged
- Knowledge artifacts preserved
- CLI flags stable

Breaking changes (if any) reserved for v3.1+:
- Potential GOALS.yaml v3 schema (add `target_repo`, `team_scope`)
- Potential knowledge pool format evolution

## Decision Record

This roadmap is a draft. Key decisions to make:

1. **When to cut v3.0.0?** After Theme 1 (adoption) has at least 2 concrete improvements shipped.
2. **Federation scope?** Start with cross-repo knowledge only, defer agent identity to v3.2+.
3. **Observability investment?** Stream-JSON and observable orchestration are already in flight — ship those first and measure adoption before expanding.

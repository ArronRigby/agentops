# Learning: Wave-Based Task Scheduling

**ID**: L1
**Category**: architecture
**Confidence**: high

## What We Learned

In swarm's wave-based execution, dependent tasks are not spawned until their dependencies complete - they don't "wait" in a queue. Wave N+1 tasks only become ready (and spawn fresh agents) after Wave N finishes.

## Why It Matters

This design prevents context degradation by giving each task a fresh agent context, and simplifies orchestration since there's no need for inter-agent synchronization or blocking waits.
